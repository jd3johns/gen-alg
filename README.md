# gen-alg: Genetic Algorithms (GA)

A very naive and simple set of genetic algorithm code.

## Running a full example

A toy problem which GA can solve is a guessing game with fitness equating to
being "warmer" or "colder":

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m ga
```

## Running the tests

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.test.txt
python -m pytest tests
```
